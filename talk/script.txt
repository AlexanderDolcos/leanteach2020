#+TITLE: Script for presentation of LeanTeach 2020

1. Vaibhav (opening remarks)

- I am pleased to introduce our project of formalizing Geometry in Lean.
- This project was interesting because it uses a completely new
  programming language called Lean -- we will have more details in
  the video.
- This reseach was a combination of Mathematics and CS.

2. Introduce goals (Alex)
- Introduce Interactive Theorem Proving, Curry-Howard Isomorphism, and Lean 
- Learn lean
- Formalize euclid, hilbert, tarski



3. Explain euclid (Nicholas)



4. Explore challenges of formalizing euclid in lean (NIcholas)
- missing axioms 
- verbose proofs
- lean being too slow




5. Explain hilbert (Lawrence)



6. Explain hilbert in lean (Lawrence)
