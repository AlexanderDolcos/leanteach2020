#+TITLE: Script for presentation of LeanTeach 2020

1. Vaibhav (opening remarks)

- I am pleased to introduce our project of formalizing Geometry in Lean.
- This project was interesting because it uses a completely new
  programming language called Lean -- we will have more details in
  the video.
- This reseach was a combination of Mathematics and CS.

- Learn lean


3. Explain euclid



4. Explore challenges of formalizing euclid in lean
- missing axioms 
- verbose proofs
- lean being too slow




5. Explain hilbert



6. Explain hilbert in lean



7. Future directions
