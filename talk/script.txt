#+TITLE: Script for presentation of LeanTeach 2020

1. Vaibhav (opening remarks)

- I am pleased to introduce our project of formalizing Geometry in Lean.
- This project was interesting because it uses a completely new
  programming language called Lean -- we will have more details in
  the video.
- This reseach was a combination of Mathematics and CS.

2. Introduce goals (Alex)
- Introduce Interactive Theorem Proving, Curry-Howard Isomorphism, and Lean 
- Learn lean
- Formalize euclid, hilbert, tarski



3. Explain euclid (Nicholas)



4. Explore challenges of formalizing euclid in lean (Nicholas)
- missing axioms 
- verbose proofs
- lean being too slow




5. Explain hilbert (Lawrence)
- Hilbert established a set of 20 assumptions as a foundation for a
  modern examination of Euclidean geometry,
- Most of these axioms relate to planar geometry, and we were
  formalize almost all of those into Lean.
- Hilbert's axioms create a synthetic geometry system, so he tends to
  avoid certain definitions in proofs (such as distance)


6. Explain hilbert in lean (Lawrence)



7. Challenges (Edward)
- In trying to formalize these axioms and propositions in Lean, we ran
  into several problems.
- Cooperative Platforms in Lean were difficult to handle: Examples
  including CoCalc and VsCode Liveshare.
- While Cocalc became extremely slow when multiple people worked on it
  at once, Liveshare required frequent restarts because of bugs in
  lean.
- In addition, liveshare would only display the Lean Info or the
  tactic state to the host, making it difficult to understand what
  errors were occuring to everyone else.
- Missing axioms and propositions were required to prove the
  propositions that both Euclid and Hilbert created.
- It especially became difficult trying to teach Lean the concept of
  "length" or "distance".
- Lastly, while writing proofs in Lean was easy, making new
  definitions for those proofs was arduous.


8. Future directions (Edward)
- In the future, it woud be best to first streamline the definitions
  of Euclid's and Hilbert's axioms
- And as shown, many more propositions need to be proven.
- The final goal in all of this is to utilize these propositions to
  finally prove the pythagorean theorem through Lean.
- Following, we plan to add axioms of other mathematicians such as
  Tarski and Birkhoff.
- In mastering plane geometry, we also hope to move to explore more
  advanced geometry like hyperbolic and spherical geometry.
- In the end, Lean is also one of many proof-checkers.  We plan to
  also explore others of different syntax such as Coq and HOL-Light.
